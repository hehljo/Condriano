## What is this?

Condriano is a self-hosted Telegram bot that monitors markets, analyzes stocks using technical indicators and market sentiment, and can automatically trade real stocks & ETFs through the [Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/) API.

Buy/sell decisions are made through a configurable **score system** — no black-box AI, no "trust me bro" signals. You can see exactly why Condriano wants to buy or sell something.

> **Important:** You need a Trading 212 **Invest** account (not CFD). Condriano doesn't do leverage. He's an otter, not a degen.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Auto-Trade** | Score-based buy/sell system (semi-auto or full-auto) |
| **Live Trading** | Market, Limit, Stop & StopLimit orders via Trading 212 |
| **Telegram Bot** | 20+ commands, daily reports, real-time alerts |
| **Technical Analysis** | RSI, SMA20/50/200, Bollinger Bands |
| **Market Sentiment** | CNN Fear & Greed Index, VIX tracking |
| **Stop-Loss / Take-Profit** | Automatic monitoring every 30 minutes |

| **Database** | SQLite for statistics, signal history, performance tracking |

## How the Score System Works

Condriano doesn't guess. He calculates a score from 0–100 based on multiple indicators:

```
BUY SIGNALS                              SELL SIGNALS
─────────────────────────────            ─────────────────────────────
RSI < 30  (oversold)           +30       RSI > 70  (overbought)      +30
RSI < 20  (extreme)            +40       RSI > 80  (extreme)         +40
Price < SMA200                 +20       Price > Bollinger Band      +15
Price < Bollinger Band         +15       Position ≥ +15%             +50
VIX > 25  (market fear)        +15       Position ≤ -10%            +100
Fear & Greed < 25              +10

Score ≥ 50 → BUY                         Score ≥ 50 → SELL
Score 30–49 → ALERT only                 Stop-Loss → IMMEDIATE SELL
Score < 30 → IGNORE
```

All thresholds are configurable via `/autotrade set` or `config/auto_trade.json`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/BotFather) (free, takes 30 seconds)
- Optional: [Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/) Invest account for live trading (see [broker comparison](docs/BROKER_COMPARISON.md) for why)

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hehljo/Condriano.git
cd Condriano
bash setup.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir -p data config
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # or vim, we don't judge
```

Fill in your values:

```env
# Telegram Bot (talk to @BotFather → /newbot)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

# Your Chat ID (talk to @userinfobot → /start)
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here

# Trading 212 (optional — leave empty for monitoring only)
T212_API_KEY=
T212_API_SECRET=
T212_MODE=practice
```

> **Tip:** Start with `T212_MODE=practice` to paper-trade first. Switch to `live` when you're comfortable. Condriano respects your risk tolerance.

### 3. Run

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

Condriano will send you a Telegram message. You're in business.

### 4. Run as a Service (Server/VPS)

```bash
sudo cp condriano.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable condriano
sudo systemctl start condriano
```

Auto-restarts on crash. Auto-starts on reboot. Condriano is persistent like that.

## FAQ

**Q: Does Condriano guarantee profits?**
A: No. Condriano is an otter with glasses, not a financial advisor. Past performance of otters does not guarantee future results.

**Q: Can I use a different broker?**
A: Currently only Trading 212 is supported. But you can use Condriano without a broker — he'll still analyze markets and send you signals via Telegram.

**Q: Is this safe for real money?**
A: Start with `T212_MODE=practice`. The score system is transparent and configurable. Position sizing and stop-losses are built in. But ultimately, you're responsible for your trades. Condriano is just the messenger (with very cute glasses).

**Q: Why "Condriano"?**
A: Some questions are better left unanswered. Just know that renaming him will void the warranty.
